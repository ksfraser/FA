This module is to help the Purchasing Manager make smart purchasing decisions.

Goals:
Identify typical turn-around times between a PO and a RECEIVE for a vendor (used for predicting stock flow)
 - First up figure out typical times by vendor
 - Second up figure typical times per SKU by vendor
Using historical purchasing on items, determine average flow (X units/day)
 - figure out COMPANY wide
 - figure out Location wide
Using flow, look at current stock levels and predict needs out to various time periods (week, month, quarter, year)
 - Company Wide
 - Location wide
Joining Supplier turnaround data to the SKUs and predictions suggest POs
 - list items needed
 - list amounts already on POs
 - list amounts on sales orders (and quotes?)
 - list turnaround and cost by supplier
