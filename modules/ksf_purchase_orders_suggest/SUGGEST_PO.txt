Purpose is to suggest what items should be on a Purchase Order for/from a vendor.

First we need to determine a suggested list of items to purchase
*items we've sold recently
**1, 3, 12 month totals and averages
**compare against stock on hand
**compare against PO date versus delivery date on a vendor basis and line item basis
*items we expect to sell soon
**1 and 3 months looking forward using historical time as well as recent sales
*items that are on BackOrder
**anything on BO must be placed onto the PO.

From that list we need to determine which are sole source (most of them) and which we source from many places (i.e. Scotts or McCallum direct).
*Past POs?
*Items that have purchase prices from more than one vendor
*Do we need to indicate which items appeared on a past PO but does not have a price against that vendor?

Indicate which vendor we typically purchase an item from
*go through past POs?

Indicate price for each vendor

have a Generate Purchase Order button
*do we search for existing POs and add to it?
**what if that PO has already been submitted?  Do POs have a draft status?
