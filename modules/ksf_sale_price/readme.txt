Goal:
	be able to have a limited time sale price that applies to different classes of customers
	Make it so that the regular price books don't need to be updated
	Have an effective and ending date
	have the sku or sku pattern (i.e. any jig shoe with wildcard matches)
	Intercept the lookup for the price book in the CART functionality
	price, or % discount or $ discount.
	have rules i.e. only 1 item discount, or must have multiple of the same sku, or multiple in a category, or....


Override the retail or registered band price (or other pricebooks as set in config)  with a Sale price.  
Allow sales price to be date limited (i.e. 1 day or week etc).

sku, price, start date, end date.

Need to tap into the CART function where it grabs the price when you add a product or change the price book.

Is there a hook that can be used in the modules to alter the price when it is being loaded?
